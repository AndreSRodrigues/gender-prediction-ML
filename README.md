This applications was developt with the intent to train my machine learning habilities.

The challange was proposed by Siraj Raval in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&t=1s&index=1&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU

**What it does:**
This aplication tests three diferente machine learning models (decision tree, gaussian tree and neural network) and see wich one can better predict the gender of a person given one's height, weight and shoe size.
It prints out on the terminal the results for each one of them.
